-- 91.6% of active customers (22 out of 24) are loyal, having placed 5 or more orders. This indicates strong customer satisfaction.
-- Only 2 users are in the New and Regular segments combined suggesting that new users are not transitioning into loyal repeat users, a sign of poor early-stage retention.
-- 27% of all registered users (9 out of 33) have never placed an order pointing to a major onboarding and conversion gap.


-- 2. How many customers have not ordered since the past thirty days?

--Promoting best-selling non-veg items in loyalty and upsell campaigns
--Personalizing offers for loyal users who favor these categories
